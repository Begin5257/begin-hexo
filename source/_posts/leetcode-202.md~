Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```
    /**
     * @param {number} n
     * @return {boolean}
     */
function isHappy(n) {
        var i=0;
        while(n!=1){
            var sum =0;
            while(n>=10){
                sum+=(n%10)*(n%10);
                n=Math.floor(n/10);
            }
            sum+=n*n;
            n=sum;
            i++;
            if(i>5&&sum!=1){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
